Dataset in the /home/public/MoviechatData/

Code in the /home/zjb/workspace/MovieChat/

### Introduction of files 

* **train_text.py**  be used to train and test text without history data
* **train_face.py**  be used to train and test face without history data
* **train.py** be used to train and test text and face with history (updating)
* **parameters.py**  set parameters
* **model.py**  defined models
* **helpers.py**  some encapsulated auxiliary functions and classes
* **predata.py**  preparations for datasets and models

### Start

parameters and other settings are mainly in **parameters.py** and some in **predata.py**

before your training, you should check it, and there are some comments(though they may be not very clear haha)

* train text without history:

``` python
python train_text.py
```

* train face without history:

``` python
python train_face.py
```

* train text with history(next phase add face):

``` python
python train.py
